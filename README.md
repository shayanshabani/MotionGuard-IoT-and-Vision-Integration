**Project Name:** *Smart Device Scheduler with Vision*

This project integrates an **ESP32** microcontroller with a **camera** and **motion detection** capabilities, allowing users to control connected devices in a highly automated and intelligent manner. The system relies on the **MQTT** protocol for real-time communication between the ESP32 and external devices, which can be anything from lights to appliances. Additionally, it incorporates a camera to detect motion, capture images, and leverage **OpenCV** for facial recognition to identify whether a person is known or unknown.

The **primary objectives** of the project are to:
1. **Automate Device Control:** Schedule and automate the operation of devices connected to the ESP32. Users can define specific time intervals during which devices will be turned on and off based on preset schedules. This is ideal for energy savings, managing appliances, or simply automating everyday tasks.
  
2. **Motion Detection and Surveillance:** A camera integrated with the ESP32 uses **motion detection** to trigger image capture whenever movement is detected within its field of view. This could be used for monitoring spaces like entryways, homes, or offices, providing enhanced surveillance with minimal manual intervention.

3. **Facial Recognition:** Using the **OpenCV** library, the system can process the captured images to recognize faces. If a detected face matches any known person in the database, the system can trigger specific actions or send notifications. If the person is unknown, a picture is automatically sent to a server for further identification, ensuring security and awareness in real-time.

4. **Real-Time Interaction via MQTT:** The **MQTT protocol** enables lightweight, real-time communication between the ESP32 and connected devices. This ensures that the system can receive and send information like device status, notifications, and camera feeds instantaneously.

### **Core Features:**
- **Time Interval Device Control:** Define custom time schedules for devices, enabling them to turn on and off at specific intervals. This is useful for controlling appliances, lights, or any other devices without manual interaction.
  
- **Motion-Activated Camera Capture:** The camera monitors the surroundings for any movement. When something is detected, the camera immediately takes a snapshot or records a video for security or monitoring purposes.

- **Facial Recognition for Enhanced Security:** The ESP32 system uses OpenCV to analyze the images taken by the camera. When a face is detected, it checks against a list of known faces, providing access control or sending alerts if an unknown individual is identified.

- **MQTT Communication:** Devices connected to the ESP32 can be controlled remotely through MQTT, allowing for seamless interaction and integration with other IoT devices. Users can check device status, control them, or receive notifications via a front-end built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

### **Technical Overview:**
1. **Hardware Components:**
   - **ESP32** microcontroller for IoT communication and device control.
   - **Camera** (such as the ESP32-CAM module) for capturing images and detecting motion.
   - **Sensors (optional)** for enhanced motion detection or environmental control.

2. **Software Components:**
   - **OpenCV** for face recognition and motion detection.
   - **MQTT** protocol for device communication and status updates.
   - **Frontend** developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for a simple and intuitive user interface.

3. **Communication & Networking:**
   - Devices are controlled via **MQTT** messages, sent from the ESP32 to connected devices and servers.
   - The camera captures images when motion is detected, and the system can either display these in real-time on the web interface or process them for facial recognition.

4. **Security Features:**
   - **Real-time Alerts:** The system can send notifications or take automated actions based on motion detection or facial recognition results, enhancing overall security.
   - **Face Database:** A database of known faces can be stored locally or on a server to check against newly detected faces.

### **Use Cases:**
- **Home Automation:** Automate the control of home devices like lights, thermostats, and fans based on specific time intervals or motion detection.
  
- **Security Systems:** Utilize the motion detection and facial recognition to monitor entryways or sensitive areas of a building, receiving alerts or taking actions based on who is detected.
  
- **Workplace or Office Monitoring:** Automatically schedule device usage (lights, fans, etc.) while also monitoring personnel or visitors via the camera.

- **Pet or Wildlife Monitoring:** Use the motion-triggered camera to observe pets or wildlife, capturing images when movement occurs.
